# Math Adventures - Adaptive Learning Prototype

A console based adaptive learning tool that helps children practice math. It uses a rule based engine to adjust difficulty (Easy/Medium/Hard) based on real time accuracy and speed.

## 📂 Project Structure
* `src/main.py`: The main game loop 
* `src/puzzle_generator.py`: Generates maths problems
* `src/tracker.py`: Logs performance metrics
* `src/adaptive_engine.py`: All the logic for difficulty increase and decrease lies here 

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Ensure you have Python 3 installed.
2. Open your terminal and navigate to the `src` folder:
   ```bash
   cd src
   python main.py
